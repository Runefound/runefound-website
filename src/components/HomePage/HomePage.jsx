				<p>{'We\'re building some simple tools such as campaign and character trackers, session notes, and spell books. However, what we are really excited about are the tools we can\'t mention yet. Tools that make your GM\'s life easier and sessions run smoother.'}</p>

				<p>{'In addition we want to address the largest barrier to entry and continual playâ€¦ Finding people to play with. We are building a platform of not only tools, but a way that groups can search for nearby players and players for nearby groups. Gone forever will be the days and weeks of tracking a new group to join or a player to fill an open seat.'}</p>

				<p>{'We are Roll For Guild, and we just want to make your RPG experiences the best possible.'}</p>
